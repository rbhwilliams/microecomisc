# microecomisc
An R package containing a set of functions useful for basic, streamlined analysis of read count matrices encountered in microbial ecology. Uses an internal function from R/phyloseq called 'rarefaction_subsample'. There are functions for counting NA/zeros/non-detects, subsampling columns of a matrix to uniform depth, double centering a marix and performing PCA, along with some functions for plotting data from RiboTagger.
